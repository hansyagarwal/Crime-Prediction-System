# CrimePredictionSystem

The project is a web application which uses HTML,CSS,JS for frontend and PHP as backend. The algorithms are Machine learning algorithms implemented in PHP (ml in php, yes its crazy). The algorithms are Apriori, Naive Bayes Classifier and Decision Tree. The source code of these algorithms are taken from repos mentioned below.
